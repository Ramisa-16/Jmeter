# JMeter Performance Load Testing

This repository contains the JMeter performance test plans, configurations, and results for the project. The tests were performed to evaluate the scalability and performance of our application under different load conditions.

## Overview

JMeter is a popular open-source tool designed for performance testing. This project includes several test plans created using JMeter to simulate user traffic and measure the application's performance under various load scenarios.

## Test Plans

The test plans in this repository simulate real-world user behavior, including:

- **Load Testing**: Testing the application under a simulated load to ensure that it can handle high traffic.
- **Stress Testing**: Pushing the application beyond its limits to identify its breaking point.
- **Performance Testing**: Measuring the response time, throughput, and other performance metrics.

## Test Results

The results of the performance tests are available below:

### Load Test Results

This graph shows the load test performance, with the number of requests processed over time. It helps evaluate how the application handles an increasing number of users.

### Stress Test Results

The stress test results show how the system performs under extreme load conditions. This test helps to identify the maximum capacity of the application before it fails.

### Performance Test Results

The performance test results include key metrics such as response time, throughput, and error rates. These metrics help assess the overall efficiency of the system under different loads.

## How to Run JMeter Tests

1. **Install JMeter**: If you haven't installed JMeter yet, download it from the [official JMeter website](https://jmeter.apache.org/).

2. **Download Test Plan**: Clone this repository or download the `.jmx` files that contain the JMeter test plans.

3. **Open Test Plan in JMeter**:
    - Launch JMeter.
    - Open the `.jmx` test plan file in JMeter.

4. **Configure Test Settings**:
    - Modify the test plan parameters (e.g., number of users, ramp-up time, etc.) to fit your needs.

5. **Run the Test**: Click on the "Start" button in JMeter to execute the test.

6. **View the Results**: You can use listeners like "View Results Tree", "Summary Report", or "Graph Results" in JMeter to view the test results.

## Conclusion

These performance tests are designed to simulate realistic usage scenarios and evaluate the application's behavior under load. The insights gained from these tests help ensure the application is ready for production.
